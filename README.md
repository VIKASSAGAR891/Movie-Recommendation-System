# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project builds a content-based movie recommender using metadata such as genres, keywords, taglines, cast, and director. The implementation follows these steps:

#Data Loading and Preprocessing:
1.Movie data is loaded from a CSV file.
2.Missing values in selected textual features are filled with empty strings.
3.All selected features are combined into a single string per movie.

#Feature Extraction:
1.TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is used to convert textual data into numerical vectors that capture word importance and frequency.

#Similarity Computation:
1.Cosine similarity is calculated between these TF-IDF vectors to determine how similar each movie is to every other movie in the dataset.

#Recommendation Logic:
1.The user provides a movie title.
2.The system finds the closest match to that title in the dataset using fuzzy string matching (difflib.get_close_matches).
3.Based on the cosine similarity score of the matched movie, it ranks and recommends the top 30 most similar movies.

This system is efficient for small to medium-sized datasets and provides personalized recommendations based on movie content, without needing user interaction history.
